	<h2>COMPUTER</h2><br>
	<h5><a href=" ">GO TO TOP</a></h5>
		<p>A computer is a general purpose device that can be programmed to carry out a set of arithmetic or logical operation. Since a sequence of operations can be readly changed, the computer can saved more than one kind of problem.</p>

	<h5 id="cpu">cpu</h5>
		<p>A central processing unit (CPU), also referred to as a central processor unit,is the hardware within a computer that carries out the instructions of a computer program by performing the basic arithmetical, logical, and input/output operations of the system. The term has been in use in the computer industry at least since the early 1960s. The form, design, and implementation of CPUs have changed over the course of their history, but their fundamental operation remains much the time</p>
<h4 id="alu">ALU</h4>
<p>The ALU is capable of performing two classes of operations: arithmetic and logic.[59] The set of arithmetic operations that a particular ALU supports may be limited to addition and subtraction, or might include multiplication, division, trigonometry functions such as sine, cosine, etc., and square roots. Some can only operate on whole numbers (integers) whilst others use floating point to represent real numbers, albeit with limited precision. However, any computer that is capable of performing just the simplest operations can be programmed to break down the more complex operations into simple steps that it can perform.</p>
